# Etch a Sketch

![Home page](https://i.imgur.com/I74V0zY.png)

A web app with which the user can sketch things on the whiteboard by hovering their mouse on it. Every time a square is hovered on, it acquires a progressively darker tint. By hovering only a few times on certain squares and many times on others, the user is able to create an image with shading.

The square size can also be controlled by clicking on the 'Clear' button. The user will be prompted to enter the number of squares per side (the higher that number, the smaller the squares will be, which will make it possible to create more detailed and fine-grained sketches).
